# OOP Logo Maker

  
## Description:
In this week's challenge we created an application that takes user input into a inquirer prompt and generated a logo.svg file. In this application the user has the choice of three shapes (circle, triangle, or square). They can input the shape they want, the text they want in that shape, the color of the text, and the color of the shape. 

## Usage Instructions
1. To get started with the application, open the cloned repository in a source code editor 
2. Open integrated terminal on index.js
3. Enter “node index.js” in the command line
4. Answer the prompted questions to meet the desired logo requirements.
5. Once completed with the questions, a "logo.svg" file will be created.
6. The file will save the user's logo and the user can save the file.
